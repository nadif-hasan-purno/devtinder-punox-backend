### **DevTinder Backend API** ‚ú®

This is the backend for a full-stack DevTinder-like application. It is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, designed to handle user authentication, profile management, and connection requests. The API is built with a strong focus on security, data validation, and maintainability.

-----

### **Features** üöÄ

This project showcases a wide range of backend development skills, including:

**API & Routing**

  * **Comprehensive RESTful API**: Implemented endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (`POST`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) user data and connection requests.
  * **Advanced Express Routing**: Utilized dynamic routes, query parameters, and regular expressions to create flexible and robust API paths.
  * **Modular Architecture**: Organized routes into dedicated Express Routers (`auth`, `profile`, `request`) for a clean and scalable project structure.

**Authentication & Security**

  * **Secure User Authentication**: Implemented a complete login/signup flow with password hashing using `bcrypt`.
  * **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used JWTs for stateless authentication, with tokens stored in secure, HttpOnly cookies.
  * **Custom Middleware**: Developed custom middleware (`userAuth`) to protect authenticated routes and handle authorization.
  * **Robust Data Validation**: Applied extensive API-level and schema-level validation on all incoming data, including custom validation functions and the `validator` library to sanitize and verify user input.

**Database & Data Management**

  * **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Utilized Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster and manage data with a focus on schema integrity.
  * **Database Schema Design**: Designed user and connection request schemas with various validation options (`required`, `unique`, `lowercase`, `trim`, `minlength`, `timestamps`).
  * **Advanced Mongoose Queries**: Explored and implemented complex queries using operators like `$or`, `$and`, `$ne`, and `$nin`.
  * **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Optimized data retrieval with the `populate` method to efficiently fetch linked documents.
  * **Database Indexing**: Explored the importance and implementation of indexes for improving query performance.

**Deployment & Infrastructure**

  * **Cloud Deployment**: The API is deployed on an **AWS EC2 instance**.
  * **Enhanced Security with Cloudflare**: Implemented a **"Full (Strict)" SSL/TLS encryption mode** on Cloudflare to ensure secure end-to-end encryption from the user's browser to the origin server.

### **Environment Variables**

To run this project, you will need to set the following environment variables in a `.env` file:

  * `MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string`
  * `JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret`
  * `PORT=your_port_number` (e.g., 9999)

### **API Endpoints**

| Method | Route | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/auth/signup` | Register a new user. |
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | Log in and receive a JWT token. |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | Log out the user. |
| `GET` | `/profile/view` | Get the profile of the logged-in user. |
| `PATCH` | `/profile/edit` | Update the logged-in user's profile. |
| `PATCH` | `/profile/password` | Update the logged-in user's password. |
| `GET` | `/user/feed` | Get a paginated list of users for the feed. |
| `GET` | `/user/requests/received`| Get all received connection requests for the user. |
| `GET` | `/user/connections` | Get all mutual connections. |
| `POST` | `/request/send` | Send a new connection request. |
| `PATCH` | `/request/review/:status/:requestId` | Accept or reject a connection request. |
| `DELETE` | `/user/:userId` | Delete a user (admin-only). |
| `GET` | `/user/:userId` | Get a user by their ID. |
| `GET` | `/user/email/:email` | Get a user by their email. |

-----

### **Deployment**

The application is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. **Cloudflare** is used as a reverse proxy, providing CDN capabilities, DDoS protection, and a "Full (Strict)" SSL/TLS encryption mode to ensure secure traffic between the user, Cloudflare, and the EC2 instance.
